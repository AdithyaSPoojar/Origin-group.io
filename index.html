            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Origin Energy was formed 18 February 2000, as a result of a demerger of
                the Australian conglomerate, Boral Limited, which saw the energy business formed as a new company,
                separate from the building and construction materials business.[3] SAGASCO became part of Origin Energy
                as part of the demerger.[4]

                Between 2001 and 2002, Origin acquired a Victorian electricity retailer licence from distributors
                Powercor and CitiPower. In 2004, the SEAGas pipeline was completed, linking the Victorian and South
                Australian gas markets. During this time, Origin obtained 50% interest in the Kupe Gas Field and Edison
                Mission Energy's 51.4% interest in New Zealand's Contact Energy.[3] Origin sold its 53% shareholding in
                Contact Energy to the market in 2015.</p>
